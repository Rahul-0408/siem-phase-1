3. What are the differences between Sysmon logs and Windows Security logs?

    Sysmon logs provide detailed technical activity (e.g., process creation, network connections, registry edits).

    Security logs focus on user authentication, login attempts, and group policy events.
    Sysmon is more granular and operational, while Security logs are more user/account-oriented.
